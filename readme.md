### Cue Reactivity
##### This experiment is a part of a wider EEG experiment. It is integrated with iMotions, Neuroelectrics, and JotForm.

-----

#### Description:
This experiment was created using [Psychopy](https://www.psychopy.org/), an open-source software package written in Python. Psychopy is a popular tool used in the fields of neuroscience and experimental psychology.


The experiment contains three stimuli categories: 1. Neutral Stimuli (NEU) 2. non-operating state (OFF) 3. in-use state (ON).
During the experiment, the participant views 24 blocks of different images. Each block contains five images from one of the above categories. 
At the end of each block, the participants are required to rate to what extent he wants to use their phone from 1 to 7 (the rating is concluded through a slider).
Each block presents five neutral, five non-operating, or five in-use state stimuli.
Each block lasts 20 seconds (four seconds per picture) and is presented in a randomized order.
A fixation cross was presented for 4.8 seconds between each block.


The entire laboratory session, including the computerized assignment, contains several stages (5 minutes each) in which the EEG and the physiological system are recorded in the following order:

1. Recording of artifacts - blinks, eye movements, head movements, and jaw locking.
2. Baseline.
3. Computer assignment (This experiment).
4. Breastfeeding and using the phone.
5. Breastfeeding without a phone.
6. Face-to-face interaction and phone use.
7. Face-to-face interaction without the phone.
8. End baseline.

A total of about 40 consecutive minutes of data.

#### Structure:
The experiment is divided into 5 main components:
1. Instructions.
2. Fixation.
3. Loop of 5 images (Netural/Phone_on/Phone_off)
4. Rating.
5. Repeat routines two-four (24 times).
5. Finish
